# LIF_Analysis
Jupyter notebook for analysis of various outputs from LIF apparatus

**From KZ edits:**

**To use:**
1. Adjust the mix variable for each data set
2. Drag and drop all of the data that is to be fit and analyzed.
	1. the program auto deletes all unnessary files (.SPE, .dat, .log)
	2. for days with multiple sets of conditions run, only drag and drop one data for one set of conditions at a time (easiest method). There are also optional lines in the 'Analysis' section that can be used to select 'Runs # through #'
